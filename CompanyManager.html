            <h1>Company Management Project</h1>
            <h2>Langauges/tools Used: Java, Javascript, HTML, and GitHub Projects</h2>
            <p> Throughout my software testing class, we were tasked with creating a web company management system. Working in an scrum SDLC and using
                GitHub Projects board to organize tasks, I worked in a team of 5 to create such a project. The system stores a company's
                projects, workers, and qualifications held by its workers. A company manager could create new projects, workers, and qualifications, 
                start and finish projects, and assign and unassign workers to a project.

            </p>
            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p> There are underlying java classes for company, worker, qualification, and project. Each of these classes has methods which define things
                like constructors, data transfer objects, and class specific functions for each class. These classes are linked up to the RestController 
                class which connects the frontend to the backend with endpoints. For example if a user navigates to the /qualifications endpoint, a table
                with all of the qualifications will be displayed.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p> Throughout this project I continued to grow my teamwork and leadership capabilities. Many of my teammates were preoccupied with
                other courses throughout this project so I stepepd up and did a lot of the administrative work like setting up meetings, creating
                and maintaining the GitHub Project board, and ensuring the project was kept on track by encouraging teammates to complete work
                throughout the sprint. I not only grew stronger in my Java, Javascript, and unit testing capabilities, I also learned a lot of new 
                skills such as test automation with tools including PMD, Randoop, and EvoSuite.
            </p>
