            <h1>GPT Reruiter</h1>

            <p> During my time at PeerSource, I was asked by my manager if I could create an AI system to help recruiters 
                look through hundreds of resumes. Working with my boss to gather requirements, I created a system that rates
                candidates on a scale from 1 to 10 on how good of a fit their resume is for a job posting. This score helps
                recruiters save time and focus on the potentially better candidates. All resumes are still viewed by a real
                person, but there is a feature available to sort out underqualified candidates who score under a certain threshold.
            </p>
            <h1>How it Works</h1>
            <p> The script iterates through an outlook inbox which all of our incoming linkedin applicants go into. All of our LinkedIn
                jobs have a name which corresponds with a name in a dictionary file that contains all of our job descriptions. The candidate's 
                resume is downloaded and it's text is read into the system. For each email, ChatGPT is given the candidate's resume and the job 
                description for the job they applied to and asked to act as a recruiter and score the person on their fit (the actual prompt is much 
                more complicated). The email is then updated to reflect this score. Optionally the person can be sent automatically to a rejection
                inbox if they fall below a certain score.
            </p>
