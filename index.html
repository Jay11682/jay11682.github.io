            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello, my name is Jay Snellings. I attended Colorado State University where I graduated in May 2024 with a 
                Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am ready to turn the skills I gained through my degree into a career 
                in software development where I can continue to grow professionally with a great team.
            </p>
            <p> I created this website as a challenge for myself to learn a little bit about web development and showcase myself
                to employers. I would love to bring that same versatility and excitement to learn to your company!
            </p>
