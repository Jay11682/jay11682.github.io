                <p class="mt-4">Working in a Scrum SDLC on a team of 4 other students, we designed a chess web application similar to <a class="hover:underline" href="https://www.chess.com/">chess.com</a>. The project focused
                    on building the system from the ground up by translating customer requirements into user stories, modeling domains,
                    and classes. We were not expected to complete the project in its entirety because of its large scale, so there was a focus 
                    placed on designing and redesigning the system as we learned about design patterns and handled coupling and cohesion in the design. We were given 
                    full creative freedom to translate the requirements as we saw fit.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">How it Works</h2>
                <p class="mt-4">Although our team did not finish the project in its entirety, the idea was that a user could log in to our website and play chess 
                    against an AI or an online opponent. The user could play multiple opponents at a time, having to wait for their opponent after they made their move.
                    Stats would be stored on each user, such as wins/losses, and be viewable on a profile. Information on past games, including game replays, was also 
                    a planned feature.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Skills Learned</h2>
                <p class="mt-4">Throughout this project, I learned how to translate requirements into user stories and use design patterns to create a project from
                    the ground up. I also continued to grow my experience working in a Scrum team.
