            <h1>Improving Memory Recall Experiment</h1>
            <h2>Langauges/Tools Used: C#, Jira, and Unity</h2>
            <p> Working in a team of 4, we developed a project in Unity which studied which font, font size, font color, and other settings gave 
                participants the best memory recall when taking a vocabulary quiz. This experiment was originally administered through
                a 2D interface, but was translated into a 3D VR project late in development as the cprofessor encouraged this.
            </p>
            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p> The Unity project was created to conduct an experiment on the participant by allowing them to pick what font, color, and size they
                think would best help their memory recall. They were then shown vocabulary words and given a quiz using the settings they chose, another 
                quiz using the "best" settings we researched, and finally a test using a mix of the best settings and the use defined settings.
                The users accuracy and speed on these quizzes were recorded.
            </p>
            <p>The mixed settings appeared to perform best in terms of accuracy, while the user-selected settings generally provided the 
                best speed metric for participants.</p>
            <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
            <p> I learned the basics of using Unity and C# throughout the creation of the experiment. Grew in my ability to work in a team and 
                conduct an experiment.
